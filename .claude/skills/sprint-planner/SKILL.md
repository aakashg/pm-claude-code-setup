# Sprint Planner

## Trigger
Activate when the user asks to "plan sprint", "sprint planning", "what should we work on", "organize the backlog".

## Behavior

### Step 1: Get Input
Ask:
1. Paste the backlog (titles, priorities, estimates)
2. Team size
3. Sprint duration (1 or 2 weeks)
4. Any constraints or deadlines

### Step 2: Plan

**Sprint Goal** (1 sentence)

**Recommended Backlog**
| Item | Estimate | Priority | Dependencies | Owner |

**Capacity Check**
- Capacity: [X points/days]
- Planned: [total]
- Buffer (20%): [amount]
- Verdict: Over/Under/Right-sized

**Stretch Goals** (if team finishes early)

**Risks to This Sprint**

## Rules
- 80% capacity is the target. Don't overload.
- Flag items with unclear requirements
- Dependencies must be resolved before sprint starts
- Every item needs a definition of done
